flame\\r\\n\\r\\nSolitude stands in the doorway\\r\\nAnd I'm struck once again by her black silhouette\\r\\nBy her long cool stare and her silence\\r\\nI suddenly remember each time we've met\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she turns to me with her hand extended\\r\\nHer palm is split with a flower with a flame\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she says \"I've come to set a twisted thing straight\"\\r\\nAnd she says \"I've come to lighten this dark heart\"\\r\\nAnd she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear\\r\\nAnd I say \"I've never thought of finding you here\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turn to the crowd as they're watching\\r\\nThey're sitting all together in the dark in the warm\\r\\nI wanted to be in there among them\\r\\nI see how their eyes are gathered into one\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she turns to me with her
